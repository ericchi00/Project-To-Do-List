# Project-To-Do-List
Simple to do list that follows The Odin Project [assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/todo-list)

## [Live Demo](https://ericchi00.github.io/Project-To-Do-List/)

## Technologies
Created using HTML, CSS and Javascript

## Features
Create to do item with title, description, and due date

Create separate "folders" that still retains each to dos in each list

## Status
Publishing to GitHub pages breaks local storage -- will switch to session storage

Putting a Space in the project name will break local storage -- fix after session storage

Refactor code even more to make it easier to read and write more comments => have each js file only have one module

Remove session/local storage and implement a backend when I learn how


## Learned
Learned how to work with objects and arrays more thoroughly

Also learned importance of separating functions into multiple Javascript files as it makes it significantly easier to troubleshoot and read

Learned a bit more about webpack and the different packages/uses
